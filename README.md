The code HD_model.py is a simulation of the Upper Colorado River Basin, above the Lee Ferry compact point.  It is a one-bucket model using an annual timestep, based on the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's 2007 Hydrologic Determination, and is validated against that model. This code is derived from codes written and used for the Colorado River Water Availability study conducted for the Colorado Water Conservation Board in 2008-2012.

HD_model.py requires HD_model_utilities.py. HD_model_test.py should be used to test HD_model.py.  HD_model_utilities has its own test routines. I have incuded the Meko 2007 paleo reconstruction data set so that you can run the test codes, along with canonical versions of the test output files.

The first version of this model is released with this DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14153896

This is my first GitHub repository, which will become more sophisticated as I do.  For now I am just publishing this code and am not using git.  I expect that the folks that will be interested in using these codes will not be GitHub sophisticates. I hope people will give feedback and contribute ideas, and even code, but for now I will incorporate accepted corrections and enhancements by hand.
