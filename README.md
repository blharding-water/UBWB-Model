This code is a simulation of the Upper Colorado River Basin, above the Lees Ferry compact point.  It is a one-bucket model using an annual timestep.  It is based on the U.S. Bureau of Reclamations 2007 Hydrologic Determination and is validated against that model. This code is derived from codes written for the Colorado River Water Availability study conducted for the Colorado Water Conservation Board in 2008-2012. 

This is my first GitHub repository, which will become more sophisticated as I do.
